## 9. Development Examples

This chapter provides representative development examples to help users quickly understand the platform capabilities and development workflow for RISC-V and AI applications.

### 9.1 RISC-V Assembly and Vector Development

#### 9.1.1 RVV Programming

RVV (RISC-V Vector) is designed for high-performance vector computing scenarios. Compared with ARM NEON / SVE, RVV provides greater flexibility in vector-length configuration and hardware adaptability.

The following table provides a brief comparison between RVV and ARM SVE:

| Feature | SVE (ARM) | RVV (RISC-V) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Instruction set architecture | ARM v8/v9 extension | Official RISC-V vector extension (V extension) |
| Design philosophy | Prioritizes hardware transparency and code compatibility | Prioritizes flexibility and configurability, allowing hardware customization |
| Register structure | Independent predicate registers (P0-P15) + Z registers | Vector registers can also be used as mask registers, configurable vector registers |
| Minimum implementation requirement | Must support 128-bit vectors | No fixed minimum length, scalable from 128 bits |
| Programming model | Emphasizes compiler-driven optimization | Better suited to manual optimization based on hardware characteristics |
| Data type support | Supports FP32/FP64, INT8/16/32/64, etc. | Supports FP16/32/64, INT8/16/32/64, etc. |
| Memory Access Pattern | Supports complex addressing | Emphasizes explicit memory operations |
| Application scenarios | High-performance computing in the ARM ecosystem (servers, supercomputers) | Customized RISC-V scenarios (AIoT, edge computing) |

Core code example:

```c
void vector_add_rvv(int32_t* vec1, int32_t* vec2, int32_t* result, size_t size) {
    // Set vector length
    size_t v1;

    for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i += v1) {
        // Set the vector length dynamically. If __riscv_vsetvlmax_e32m4() > size - i,
        // the length is set to size - i; otherwise, it is set to __riscv_vsetvlmax_e32m4().
        v1 = __riscv_vsetvl_e32m4(size - i);

        vint32m4_t v1 = __riscv_vle32_v_i32m4(&vec1[i], v1);  // Load vec1
        vint32m4_t v2 = __riscv_vle32_v_i32m4(&vec2[i], v1);  // Load vec2
        vint32m4_t vresult = __riscv_vadd_vv_i32m4(v1, v2, v1);  // Vector addition
        __riscv_vse32_v_i32m4(&result[i], vresult, v1);  // Store result
    }
}
```

Inside the cloud instance, code can be edited through Code Server and compiled and validated by using `gcc`.
